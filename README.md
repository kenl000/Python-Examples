git push -u origin main

The Git command git push -u origin main is used to push your local changes to the remote repository. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

git push: This command is used to push changes from your local repository to a remote repository.
-u origin: This flag sets the upstream branch for your local main branch to origin/main. This means that Git will remember that your local main branch is associated with the remote main branch on the origin remote.
main: This specifies the local branch that you want to push to the remote repository.
So, in essence, this command pushes your local main branch to the remote origin repository and sets the upstream branch for your local main branch to origin/main. This means that in the future, you can simply run git push to push your changes to the remote repository without having to specify the remote and branch names.
